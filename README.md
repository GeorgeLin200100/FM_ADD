## FM_ADD

### **Description** 

Fixed Point Addition of Matrix A (Size: FM_COL * FM_ROW) and Matrix B (Size: FM_COL * FM_ROW). Implemented With the DDR4 Naive Interface and Simple Dual-Port BRAMs. 

### **Features**  

1. **Highly Parameterized.**
2. **Already Tested Under Several Scenarios,** Including (FM_COL, FM_ROW) = (8, 4) / (16, 4) / (16, 8) / (64, 4) /(64, 8) /(128, 4), and various fixed point number configurations. In the uploaded code, the author utilizes **signed** 64-bit fixed point number with 15 bits of fraction part. Other configurations are welcome! Btw, You can also change *real_setting* in Vivado wave window and set the *binary points* variable to 15 to verify the results yourself.
3. **Self-Check Results.** I have implemented self-check logics in the code to verify the correctness of addition results automatically. You can refer to the *error_num* signal to check whether error arises.  



### Procedure

1. Generate FM_COL * FM_ROW * 2 fixed point data and write them to DDR
2. Read the first FM_COL * FM_ROW data from DDR to BRAM0, the rest FM_COL * FM_ROW data to BRAM1
3. Read from BRAM0 and BRAM1 simultaneously, perform fixed point addition, write FM_COL * FM_ROW results to BRAM0
4. Read FM_COL * FM_ROW results from BRAM0 and write them to DDR
5. Read FM_COL * FM_ROW results from DDR and check correctness 



### Warning

1. Data tested are generated by *$random*, **NO** real matrix data are tested.
2. The fixed point adder engine **haven't** consider overflow and underflow conditions. In the uploaded version, the author copes with this problem by carefully generating **in-the-range** random numbers.
3. The uploaded version **only** has been tested under behavioral simulation. **No** guarantees in synthesis and post-synthesis simulation.
4. Data size larger than (128, 4) **haven't** been tested.
